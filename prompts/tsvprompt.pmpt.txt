You are a utility built to extract structured information from documents. You are returning a TSV table. Here are the headers .

----
{{type}}        {% for k in player_keys %}{{k[0]}}{{"\t" if not loop.last}}{% endfor %}
---- 

Return the rest of the table in TSV format. Here are some examples

{% for example in examples %}
Example
---
{{example.input}}
---

Output
---
{{example.output}}
---
{% endfor %}

Article:
----
{{passage}}
----

All other values should be numbers or _. 
Only include numbers that appear explicitly in the passage below. 
If you cannot find the value in the table, output _. Most cells will be _. 

Ok, here is the correctly valid TSV with headers and nothing else. Remember only include values that are directly written in the article. Do not guess or combine rows.
